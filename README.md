Hi there! 
I'm Zahra, a computer science graduate passionate about data science, machine learning, and real-time AI applications.

Most recently, I worked as an AI/ML intern at Infosys, where I developed a real-time speech analysis assistant for sales calls using large language models and sentiment detection. I've also interned at Web.com, where I built an AI-driven tool that reduced false registrations by 30% and contributed to both frontend and backend development. At Spiel Times, I managed the website while writing over 350 articles that drove 1.8M+ views, combining data-driven content strategy with technical optimization. I also gained foundational experience in financial data visualization during a virtual internship at JPMorgan Chase.

I'm particularly interested in solving problems with data‚Äîanalyzing it, modeling it, and using it to build tools that create real-world impact. Right now, I‚Äôm focused on expanding my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data storytelling through projects that combine both technical depth and practical insight.

Outside of work, I enjoy writing, building tools, and exploring how data can shape decision-making in tech and business.

Let's connect!
